Hello, my name is Vladimir.
I do research in applied operations and options trading. I am interested in markets of all kinds—not just financial ones—but anywhere pricing reflects some informational or latency edge.

***I am currently looking for a role in quantitative research and financial data science.***

You can find examples of my data-science and operations - related research in 'projects'.

### About me

I used to be deep into math—especially mathematical analysis—but these days it’s more of a hobby. Occasionally, I plan to publish short articles based on research I’ve done in my free time: from why the Normal distribution is a sphere (turns out there are very useful analogies between geometric figures and distributions), to some mispricings in commodities markets like wine auctions and poker tournament entries.


I have always been interested in strategic games—both in developing educated bets on players and in figuring out optimal strategies. Here’s the first stone in a series of analyses:  **Solving Poker:** [Part 1](https://vkhismatullin.github.io/projects/naive_poker_game/).

My previous academic work included extensive deep learning, with a focus on time series analysis and Bayesian methods. I spent three years working on this intersection. One example is [Interpretable Time Series Generation Using SCVAE](https://github.com/VKhismatullin/TimeSeriesGen).
