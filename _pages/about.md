Hello, my name is Vladimir.
I am doing research on option pricing in a practically-relevant way.

I used to do a lot of math and was a big math analysis guy, but now it's more of a hobby of mine. From time to time I will publish some articles from why the Normal distribution is a sphere, why that might be important, to  some mispricings in commodities markets that some people may appreciate.


I am also very much interested in strategic games, both from the point of developing educated bets on players and deriving optimal strategies. [Link to poker files] 

More than that, I have spent 3 years on time series analysis, Bayesian deep learning. I have spent a lot of time on [Link to generation files]

My main interest is in data analysis for markets. Not just purely financial, everything that involves pricing.
